    <h1>All About HTML</h1>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
        It is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. </p>
    

    <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
    <p>Semantic HTML is the correct use of HTML to reinforce the meaning of content on a web page, rather than merely define its appearance. 
        Semantically correct HTML helps search engines, screen readers, and other user devices determine the significance and context of web content.</p>   
    
    <p>So we use typography. Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.</p>
